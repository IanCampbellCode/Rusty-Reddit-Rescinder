# Rusty-Reddit-Rescinder
A small command line utility to scrub your post and comment history from reddit, written in rust!

## Goal
With privacy concerns at an all time high, its easy to miss the elephant in the room, our public post history. Though Reddit may not be collecting our data, its often times pretty easy to link a reddit account to a particular person. People typically get comfortable and post somewhat personal information candidly, maybe a post about their local gym, a mention of a highschool gym teacher, and a comment about their lousy boss. With enough of these tiny snippets of information, somebody can put together a pretty accurate profile of a person.

### Why This matters
Privacy is something every person values differently, but posting candidly can lead to some serious consequences. Below are links to a few people who have been greatly embarrased or suffered some hardship after their reddit accounts were tracked down:
